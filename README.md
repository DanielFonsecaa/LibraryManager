This project is a Bookstore Management Application that demonstrates a full-stack web application integrating both back-end and front-end technologies. It is designed to manage a bookstore's inventory, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books via a user-friendly interface. The application is built using a combination of modern Java-based backend frameworks and dynamic JavaScript-based front-end technologies.

--*Features*

   Book Inventory Management: Users can view, add, edit, and delete books from the inventory.

   Search Functionality: Users can search for books based on various criteria, such as title, author, year, or ISBN.

   Responsive Design: The front-end is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.

   Dynamic Updates: The front-end uses JavaScript to dynamically fetch and update data without requiring full page reloads.

   RESTful API Integration: The front-end interacts with the back-end through a REST API, making the system scalable and adaptable for future integrations.
# ü§∑üèº Usage

   Main Page: Displays all books and provides options to search and add new books.
   Book Detail Page: Allows you to view, edit, or delete individual book records.

--*Additional Information*

   Development Stage: The application currently uses a test database located in the resources folder. This setup is for development purposes and does not affect the production environment.
## ü™ö Built With

#### Back-End

Java: Core language for backend development.

   Spring MVC: Manages the web layer and provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on the book inventory.

   Hibernate: Handles database operations and maps Java objects to a MySQL relational database.

   Thymeleaf: Renders server-side HTML views when needed.

   Maven: Manages dependencies and builds the project.

   Tomcat: Serves as the web server to deploy the application.

#### Front-End

   JavaScript: Fetches data from the backend API, handles user interactions, and dynamically updates the UI.

  HTML: Defines the structure of web pages.

CSS: Styles and layouts web pages.

   FontAwesome: Provides icons for enhanced UI.
